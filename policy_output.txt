#### Policy Recommendations:

**I. Enhance Financial Sustainability and Revenue Diversification**

*   **1.1 Mandate Revenue Stream Analysis & Optimization:**
    *   **Policy:** All airports shall conduct an annual review of their revenue streams (Hangar Space Rentals, Aircraft Parking, Building Rentals, Lease of Ground Area, Fuel Flowage Fees, Landing/Gate/Ramp Fees, Concession Revenues, Sales and Services, Other Operating Revenues) to identify underperforming assets and opportunities for growth.
    *   **Action:** Develop best practice guidelines for pricing strategies for various aeronautical and non-aeronautical services. Encourage aggressive pursuit of non-aeronautical revenues (e.g., commercial development on ground leases, diverse concession offerings, and leveraging unique airport assets).
    *   **Rationale:** Many airports, especially smaller ones, show significant operating losses and rely heavily on non-operating revenues. Diversifying and maximizing operating revenues is crucial for financial health (e.g., Fresno, LA, SF, San Jose show strong diverse revenue streams; many others are heavily reliant on limited sources).

*   **1.2 Strategic Grant and Non-Operating Revenue Utilization:**
    *   **Policy:** Airports must develop clear strategies for applying for and utilizing state and federal aid for construction, as well as other intergovernmental grants.
    *   **Action:** Establish a state-level resource hub to assist airports in identifying eligible grants, application processes, and compliance requirements. Prioritize grants that address critical infrastructure needs and demonstrate a clear path to improved operational efficiency.
    *   **Rationale:** "Aid for Construction" and "Other Intergovernmental" funds are vital for many airports (e.g., Madera, El Paso De Robles, Merced, Oakland, Victorville show significant capital contributions), but their use should be strategic to avoid perpetuating reliance without improving core operating income.

*   **1.3 Address Negative Net Position and Operating Losses:**
    *   **Policy:** Airports consistently showing negative "Operating Income (Loss)" and/or "Unrestricted Net Position" shall be required to submit a comprehensive financial recovery plan.
    *   **Action:** The state (e.g., Caltrans Aeronautics Division) will provide financial analysis support and oversight for these recovery plans, focusing on revenue enhancement and cost control measures. Plans should include measurable targets for improving operating income and net position.
    *   **Rationale:** Many airports show significant operating losses (e.g., Auburn, Chico, Redding, Santa Monica, Tracy in both 2023 & 2024), and some have negative unrestricted net positions, indicating long-term financial vulnerability.

**II. Optimize Operating Costs and Asset Management**

*   **2.1 Implement Benchmarking for Operating Expenses:**
    *   **Policy:** Airports shall annually benchmark their "Operating Expenses" (Personnel Services, Contractual Services, Materials and Supplies, Maintenance and Operation for various areas) against peer airports of similar size and operational scope.
    *   **Action:** The state will facilitate data sharing and provide a standardized benchmarking tool. Airports will be required to justify significant variances from benchmarks and propose corrective actions.
    *   **Rationale:** While some expenses like "Depreciation and Amortization" are significant due to capital assets, other controllable expenses (Personnel, Contractual, Maintenance) vary widely and present opportunities for efficiency.

*   **2.2 Evaluate Outsourcing and Shared Services:**
    *   **Policy:** Airports shall regularly evaluate the cost-effectiveness of providing services in-house versus outsourcing, and explore opportunities for shared services with neighboring airports or local government entities.
    *   **Action:** Airports reporting "Yes" for "Are airport services provided by other than the local agency?" (e.g., Bakersfield, Corona, El Paso De Robles, Fullerton, Lompoc, Oceanside, Petaluma, Reedley, Riverside, Santa Barbara, South Lake Tahoe, Tehachapi, Victorville, Visalia, Watsonville) should share best practices. The state can develop models for regional cooperation on procurement, maintenance, or administrative functions.
    *   **Rationale:** The data shows some airports already outsource services. This can lead to cost savings and improved service quality by leveraging specialized external expertise or economies of scale.

*   **2.3 Optimize Asset Utilization:**
    *   **Policy:** Airports shall implement strategies to maximize the utilization of key assets such as "Hangar Space Rentals," "Aircraft Parking," "Parking Apron Acreage," and "Aircraft Tie-Down Acreage."
    *   **Action:** Conduct regular occupancy rate analyses for hangars and parking. Explore dynamic pricing models, waiting list management, and incentive programs for new tenants or increased aircraft movements.
    *   **Rationale:** Revenue from hangar and parking space is a core operating income for many. Ensuring high occupancy and efficient use of these assets is critical.

**III. Strategic Infrastructure Investment and Modernization**

*   **3.1 Develop Long-Term Capital Improvement Plans (CIP):**
    *   **Policy:** All airports must develop and regularly update a multi-year Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) that aligns with their strategic goals, addresses deferred maintenance, and incorporates sustainability.
    *   **Action:** CIPs should clearly link proposed projects to expected improvements in safety, operational efficiency, or revenue generation. The state will offer guidance on lifecycle cost analysis for infrastructure investments.
    *   **Rationale:** Significant "Depreciation and Amortization Expenses" across the board highlight the substantial capital investment in airport infrastructure. Strategic planning ensures these assets are managed effectively over their lifespan.

*   **3.2 Promote Sustainable Infrastructure:**
    *   **Policy:** Encourage and incentivize airports to adopt environmentally sustainable practices in their infrastructure development and operations.
    *   **Action:** Prioritize state funding for projects that incorporate renewable energy, water conservation, efficient lighting, and sustainable building materials. Explore policies to reduce "Annual Fuel Consumption (Gallons)" where feasible or to promote alternative fuels.
    *   **Rationale:** While not directly measured in financial terms, environmental efficiency can lead to long-term cost savings and align with state environmental goals.

**IV. Improve Data Quality and Financial Reporting Standards**

*   **4.1 Standardize Financial Reporting and Data Collection:**
    *   **Policy:** The state shall establish mandatory, standardized financial reporting formats and data collection methodologies for all California airports, consistent with GAAP and GASB pronouncements.
    *   **Action:** Provide ongoing training and technical assistance to airport finance personnel. Implement a quality control mechanism for submitted data, potentially including regular desk audits or field reviews.
    *   **Rationale:** Frequent "Adjustment" reasons like "Correction of error," "Correction of beginning balance," and "Unaudited TB" across the data set indicate a need for improved data quality and consistency, which is fundamental for effective policy-making and oversight.

*   **4.2 Timely and Accurate Reporting:**
    *   **Policy:** Establish clear deadlines and penalties for non-compliance for the submission of financial and statistical data.
    *   **Action:** Implement an electronic reporting system to streamline submissions and improve data integrity. Develop feedback loops to inform airports of common errors and areas for improvement in their reporting.
    *   **Rationale:** Timely and accurate data is essential for the state to monitor the health of its airport system and to allocate resources effectively.

**V. Tailored Support and Categorization**

*   **5.1 Differentiate Policy Application by Airport Type:**
    *   **Policy:** Recognize that major commercial airports (e.g., LA, SF, San Jose, Palm Springs) have different operational complexities, revenue potential, and efficiency levers compared to regional or general aviation airports.
    *   **Action:** Develop tiered policy guidelines and support programs tailored to the size, traffic volume ("Total Aircraft Movements," "Number of Passengers Enplaned/Deplaned"), and primary function of each airport. For smaller airports, focus may be on maintaining essential services and community benefit, rather than solely on profit maximization.
    *   **Rationale:** A uniform policy across all airports, given their vast differences in scale and activity, would be inefficient and potentially detrimental.

*   **5.2 Technical Assistance for Smaller Airports:**
    *   **Policy:** Provide dedicated technical assistance and capacity building programs for smaller airports that may lack the internal resources for complex financial analysis, strategic planning, or grant management.
    *   **Action:** Offer workshops, template documents, and direct consulting services to help these airports improve their financial management and operational efficiency.
    *   **Rationale:** Many smaller airports (e.g., Banning, Calipatria, Woodlake, Willits, Dunsmuir) have limited revenues and may struggle with the administrative overhead required for robust efficiency initiatives.

**Implementation and Oversight:**

*   **Lead Agency:** California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), specifically its Aeronautics Division, in collaboration with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for certain aspects.
*   **Monitoring:** Annual reporting dashboards will track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as operating income ratio, non-aeronautical revenue growth, asset utilization rates, grant utilization, and data accuracy scores.
*   **Review Cycle:** This policy framework should be reviewed and updated every three to five years to adapt to evolving industry trends, technological advancements, and the changing needs of California's airport system.

By implementing this comprehensive and tailored policy framework, California can move towards a more efficient, sustainable, and resilient airport network that serves the diverse needs of its communities and economy.
